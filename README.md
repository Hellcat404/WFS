ICT Assignment from CAVC to design and create a wood flooring company's application to price check different flooring types.

This application used a locally running MySQL server to store all data related to the system.
Due to this being an old project, the way this was implemented could be improved upon greatly with more experience.

This project shows how my skills were years ago and they have only improved since.

This project was mostly free form and allowed me to explore possibilities that some of my newer projects such as university projects didn't allow me to explore due to tight requirements.
